# Simplified Social Networking Application
The goal of this web application project is to create a simplified social networking application. The application has a function that allows users to create their accounts to log in to this social network, and users can search for other existing people in this simplified social network application to connect with. The user is also able to view mutual friends between them and other existing people before deciding to send the friend request. Furthermore, by applying secure coding best practices into development, the access control is well-designed to prevent broken access control and insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities of the application. The inputs that can be controlled by clients are developed with appropriate sanitization to mitigate other types of security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), and command injection.
